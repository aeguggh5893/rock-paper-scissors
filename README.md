rock paper scissors project

Setting up rock paper scissors project for odin project. This is the first version right now.

Finally finished the first version of the rock paper scissors portion. It does feel a bit clunky and I am unsure of some parts but for
the most part, it seems to be working as intended. Although very straighforward, there are a lot of things that could be improved on but
for now, I will just leave it as is until I gain more understanding of how I can improve this code in the future.
